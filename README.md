# VR Zombie Shooter – Unity (C#)

For my school project, I developed a VR zombie shooter game using **Unity** and **C#**, together with one teammate.  
To build this project, I followed three Unity Learn courses:  
*Unity Essentials*, *Junior Programmer*, and *VR Development Pathway*.

These courses helped me build a strong foundation, and I continued with my own research and experimentation to bring the game to life.

**Note:** I've only included the code in this GitHub project due to the project's size.

I've also recorded a playthrough — feel free to check it out or skip through it: https://youtu.be/m38jtJP-4j8
